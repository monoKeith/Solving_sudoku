# Solving_sudoku
I am trying to compare the cost of time for each approach to solve sudoku. It proves the importance of efficiency of algorithms.

Some approachs are never gonna solve a large size problem (I mean, at least for several hunderds of years), some other approachs can solve a really large problem in a few minutes.
